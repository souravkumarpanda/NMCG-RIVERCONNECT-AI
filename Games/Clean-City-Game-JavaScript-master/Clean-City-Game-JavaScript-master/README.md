# Clean-City-Game-JavaScript

Letâ€™s take the first step to help Environment. As a first step people should know how to separate the waste. And So, I have made a game which can help people to learn what kind of garbage should go in what type of trashcan. And I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to develop this game. I have done my designing in HTML and CSS and functionality as drag and drop I have done it in JavaScript. Where I have created basic things like one start button with what your game will starts. I have placed the garbage on the screen with the city in the background and when you hit the start button,1-minute timer, and you have to drag a garbage and trash it into the proper trashcan. As a 1st level when you will trash the garbage you will get positive points. If you will not be able to complete your game in one minute, your game is over, but you complete everything in time you will reach to next level with one useful fact related to waste collection and garbage disposal. All the trash items are draggable you have to choose the proper bin to trash it. And your score will be calculated according to it.
